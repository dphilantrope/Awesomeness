This todo list web app, with Harry Potter style todos, is part of a code-along from The Web Developer Bootcamp, 
by instructor Colt Steele.  It features a list that a user may add to by entering text in an input, and delete 
from by clicking the 'delete' icon on a list item.  The text input can be toggled by clicking the 'write' 
icon on the top-right corner, and then a todo may be entered.  The styling is done with CSS and the javascript 
jQuery library, which also handles the HTML manipulation and the animation effects.
