This startup landing page, with a cat themed service, is part of a code-along from The Web Developer Bootcamp, 
by instructor Colt Steele.  It styles the page's elements using the Twitter Bootstrap 3, CSS framework.  It 
features a navbar containing a logo, buttons, and icons; as well as a main div containing a header and a call 
to action button.  The page implements Bootstrap's grid system for responsiveness to resizing.  When the page is 
reduced to tablet size, the navbar collapses and is toggled in and out by a button.
