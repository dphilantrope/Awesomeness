This color game web app, which uses the rgb color system, is part of a code-along from The Web Developer 
Bootcamp, by instructor Colt Steele.  It features a header with the red, green, and blue amounts from 0-255, 
which makes up a color for the user to pick.  The color is selected randomly, along with two or five other 
color, depending on the difficulty, and the colors are placed into squares.  When the user clicks an incorrect 
square, that square disappears and text appears on the stripe: "Try Again".  When the user clicks the correct 
square, the squares reappear and all of them display the correct color; and so does the header's background.  
The "New Colors" button displays "Play Again?", and the stripe shows "Correct!".  The document's text, colors, 
and element clicks were manipulated with javascript, using the HTML Document Object Model.
