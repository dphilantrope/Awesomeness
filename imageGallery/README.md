This image gallery, with its geographic settings, is part of a code-along from The Web Developer Bootcamp, 
by instructor Colt Steele.  It features styling with the Twitter Bootstrap 3 CSS framework, which aligns the 
gallery using its CSS grid system.  The webpage is responsive to resizing, as the gallery reduces its columns 
when the page size reduces to tablet and mobile sizes.  There is a navbar with an icon, logo, and buttons; and 
a jumbotron which showcases the header and content (navbar collapses at tablet size and toggles with a button).
